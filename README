As a final project for Computational Discrete Mathematics at CMU,
I wrote this model checker. If I feel inspired, one day I'll make it
decidable instead of semidecidable. Currently it returns true or loops
infinitely. The original readme is attached below.

Apparently this is semidecidable, and I have no idea why :(

My guess is a bug in my DFS code, since checking the propositions
by hand using the included runDFA seems to work correctly. But I have
no idea where the bug in my DFS could be.

But, it's already a day late, so here's what I have ^_^ 
The fact that it can answer somewhat nontrivial true things 
is still pretty cool
